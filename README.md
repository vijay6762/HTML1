# HTML1
Look what's here!! I created a basic form based on pure HTML.

An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.
The HTML <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input:

<form>
....
form elements
....
</form>
The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.
  
The HTML <input> element is the most used form element.An <input> element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the type attribute.
